TUTORATS:

ATS is a full-fledged programming language that unifies
implementation with formal specification, and the core of ATS is
a call-by-value functional language inspired by ML. Please visit
http://www.ats-lang-org to find more on ATS.

The project TUTORATS focuses on the design and implementation of a
tutorial system for ATS, helping teach/learn ATS in particular and
programming in general.
