I simply set things up in this part.

Part1/Makefile: for compiling the project:

Part1/game.sats:

At this point, I use [game.sats] to store all type definitions
and function declarations. This practice should work well for a small
project.

Part1/game.dats: This is the main file.

Part1/game_board.dats: for implementing the game-board.
Right now, I use a matrix-with-size to represent a board. If it makes
sense to use a dependently typed matrix, then I will do it later. As of
now, it does not seem to be the case.

Part1/game_config.dats: for handling game-configuration.
At this moment there are three global variables for storing the values of
M, N, and K.

Part1/game_initize.dats: for implementing game-initialization
Part1/game_finalize.dats for implementing game-finalization
Part1/game_mainloop.dats: for implementing the loop of playing the game

Part1/game_mylib: for building the library needed for this project

######

To compile, please just do 'make'. Then an excutable 'M-N-K-game' is
generated.  Please do './M-N-K-game' to execute it. Of course, there is
really not much to see at this point.
